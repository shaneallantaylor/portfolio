            <h1>Shane Taylor / front-end web developer</h1>
            <p class="sub-title">Web development started as a passion for me (at age 14) in 1999 with fan websites for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_3000" target="_blank" class="p-link">SimCity 3000</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heS_dz3XcPQ" target="_blank" class="p-link">Moto-X 2000</a>. I graduated with a BA in Social Work and after spending more than a few years working at the intersection of social work and software, I'm returning to my roots - cutting edge web development for things I care about.</p>

            <p class="expo-text 1 nope hidden">Megan Thompson is a professional photographer working at Hopeless Records and was in dire need of an updated website. I designed the the site with input from her while incorporating best practices for web development, include mobile first and responsive design. It is a single-page application, utilizing HTML5 History, a custom Django backend, URL routing and the Vimeo API. I also wrote a full technical guide for managing the backend through the custom Django installation so Megan is in full control of the content on her site.</p>
            <p class="expo-text 2 nope hidden">This was a side project of mine that Iâ€™d wanted to complete since I started my first social work job after college. Many people are not familiar with the basics of rental prices and what landlords typically expect. This calculator takes in very basic user information and succinctly explains a suggested monthly rental amount that landlords will deem affordable to the end-user and links them to a custom craigslist search based on their income. All the information within the calculation is based the latest HUD data.</p>
            <p class="expo-text 3 nope hidden">The creation of this gallery was a challenge put forth by my friends at <a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a>. The task was to build a photo gallery with a fixed-width, multiple-row layout. There were also a few constraints to consider when laying out the images in the gallery: The order of images must be maintained, images in the same row must have the same height, but must also maintain their aspect ratio (+/- 1px) and not be cropped, rows are variable-height, but must be less than the maximum row height, every row except the last must have total width (including spacing between images) equal to the container width, and the last row must have total width less than or equal to the container width.</p>
            <p class="expo-text 4 nope hidden">Another fun challenge: replicate a simple, turn-based game with clearly defined winning scenarios. For this tasked I focused on improving my workflow process and scaleable code. Also, Blake Griffin wanted to help out, so his influence is felt throughout the game.</p>
